## Custom themes

The bare minimum required for a custom theme is a `base.html` template file. This should be placed in a directory at the same level as the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file. Within `mkdocs.yml`, specify the `theme_dir` option and set it to the name of the directory containing `base.html`. For example, given this example project layout:

    mkdocs.yml
    docs/
        index.md
        about.md
    custom_theme/
        base.html
        ...

You would include the following setting to use the custom theme directory:

    theme_dir: 'custom_theme'

If used in combination with the `theme` configuration value a custom theme can be used to replace only specific parts of a built-in theme. For example, with the above layout and if you set `theme: mkdocs` then the `base.html` file would replace that in the theme but otherwise it would remain the same. This is useful if you want to make small adjustments to an existing theme.

The simplest `base.html` file is the following:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
      <body>
        {{ content }}
      </body>
    </html>

Article content from each page specified in `mkdocs.yml` is inserted using the `{{ content }}` tag. Stylesheets and scripts can be brought into this theme as with a normal HTML file. Navbars and tables of contents can also be generated and included automatically, through the `nav` and `toc` objects, respectively. If you wish to write your own theme, it is recommended to start with one of the [built-in themes](https://github.com/tomchristie/mkdocs/tree/master/mkdocs/themes) and modify it accordingly.
